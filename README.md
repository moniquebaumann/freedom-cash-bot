Corrupt politicians and other non player charakters have [hijacked Bitcoin](https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1781575449065427180) in many ways.
Some of them even laundered their corrupt FIAT money into Bitcoin.  
The majority of Bitcoin is atm of writing this not owned by Freedom-, Peace- and Truth Lovers. This is why we reshuffle the cards :) leveraging the latest Blockchain Technology Improvements like Proof of Stake & sophisticated L2 Scaling.
